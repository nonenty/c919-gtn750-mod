### 1. Using FLC Mode in Autopilot
The FLC mode in GTN750 is not coupled with autothrust. It maintains airspeed by adjusting pitch when engaged. We recommend:
- Disengaging the C919X's autothrust before engaging FLC mode
- Manually adjusting thrust to desired level after activation

### 2. No Lateral Guidance After Takeoff
If NAV mode isn't providing lateral guidance after takeoff (known issue):
- Preselect runway heading before takeoff
- Engage HDG mode while on ground
- After airborne, select appropriate heading to intercept NAV track
- Re-engage NAV mode to establish on course

### 3. Missing Waypoints or Procedures
GTN750 requires runways/procedures to exist in the simulator:
- Ensure you have up-to-date scenery installed
- Try Navigraph navdata if issues persist
- Verify all waypoints match your flight plan
- Confirm departure AND arrival procedures exist before airborne
